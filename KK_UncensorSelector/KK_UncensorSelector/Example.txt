//Uncensor Selector guide
//Lines starting with // are comments and are ignored.
//Uncensors are applied to characters by setting them up in a .txt file inside the KK_UncensorSelector folder.
//All .txt files are read. If you create a body modification specific to a character, you can include
//a KK_UncensorSelector .txt file along with the mod and card. Users can put the .txt file in without needing to manually
//edit any files


//First KK_UncensorSelector checks if an uncensor has been assigned to the character and applies it.
//Uncensors are applied like so:

//LastName FirstName,chara/oo_base_modded.unity3d

//If a character only has one name it's fine to just use that:

//FirstName,chara/oo_base_modded.unity3d
//LastName,chara/oo_base_modded.unity3d


//Obviously you must not include the // at the start of the line or it cannot work.
//Second, if you have assigned a gender specific uncensor it will be applied:

//Female,chara/oo_base_modded_female.unity3d
//Male,chara/oo_base_modded_male.unity3d

//or:

//F,chara/oo_base_modded_female.unity3d
//M,chara/oo_base_modded_male.unity3d


//Third, if you specify a wild card (*) it will be applied to all characters that do not meet the above criteria:

//*,chara/oo_base_modded.unity3d


//Finally, if no wild card is specified and no other criteria is met the default oo_base is used.
//Sideloader uncensors and hard mod uncensors that override or overwrite oo_base will be applied instead, if applicable.
//A complete file may look something like this:

//F,chara/oo_base_moderchan.unity3d
//Bessie,chara/oo_base_KK_LO.unity3d
//Michelle,chara/sacinnie.unity3d
//Dawn,chara/sacmeaty.unity3d
//Haruno Mecha,chara/oo_base_amputee.unity3d
//Hailey,chara/oo_base_futa_no_balls.unity3d
